The **GNURadio** is an open source community which provides continuous signal processing solutions for Software Defined Radio (SDR). The basic development of GNURadio toolkit is done in a manner to make it compatible with low-cost RF hardware to achieve SDRs. Primarily written in Python and C++, the toolkit provides user to implement radio systems in a real environment. The aim of this Project is to develop an OFDM Receiver for GNURadio and integrate **wireshark** into it. Hence enabling GNURadio as a tool which can receive the packets for OFDM and analyse the algorithm implemented on network as well.
